* BUG Clozure drops to debugger on nispbot input
  Not totally sure why atm, needs fixed at some point. The problem is
  the timeout seems to also abort the debugger which is different
  behavior then with sbcl.

* TODO Define property-list type
  Verify input is a property list etc.

  Huh?

  This is starting to become independent of :nisp itself. I don't want

  Update: Now has its own asd definition, needs to be split into its own
  repository at some point in the future.
