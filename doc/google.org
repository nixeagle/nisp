#+TITLE: nisp.google

Various lisp functions allowing google searches and
translations. Currently the source is at [[file:../irc-bot/google.lisp][google.lisp]]. [fn:1]

* Search
  The function =GOOGLE-SEARCH= queries google for the passed in
  string. The result is a string with a list of links.

  : (google-search "common lisp")
  Yields a string with 10 links seperated by spaces.

*** TODO Return a list of links
    Use a real list, not a returned string as we do now.

* Translate
  The only exported function is =GOOGLE-TRANSLATE=. This takes some text
  to translate and arguments afterwards represent the language to
  translate to.

  : (google-translate "hi" "en" "es")
  : => "hola"

  : (google-translate "hi" "en" "es" "it")
  : => "salve"
