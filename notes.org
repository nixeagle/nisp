*** *readtable* in package
    It is probably not a very good idea to put this in the package
    itself and instead associate the readtable with the wrapper object
    safe-package. If the readtable is not stored in the package itself
    or the readtable is somehow made into a constant that cannot be
    changed ever inside the package... we should be safe.

      (input 1 2 output 1 2))

(test list

      (input (1 2) output (1 2)))
