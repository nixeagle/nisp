* TODO Shadowing import stuff
move from import-from to shadowing-import-from for all packages using
define-export-system. This lets us be one step removed from the common
lisp package and limits damage to the overall (lisp) system should
something manage to


* TODO Sandbox level segragation
I should be able to create sandboxes with different sets of imports
and use different ones depending on who is accessing them.


* TODO Rename safe-external package to something else
As it stands the name implies these are external to the safe
package. Most of what is in here are variables and functions directly
related *to* safe. As such the name is a misnomer.

* TODO Define a useful documentation function
Right now documentation is dependent on swank.

* DONE Enable test again for nistilities
  CLOSED: [2009-12-15 Tue 21:00]
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-12-15 Tue 21:00]
  :END:
Both nisp and nistilities tests

Use (lift:run-tests :suite 'test-mixin). However I need to generate one
of those that is specific only to nisp related stuff. mixin seems to run
all defined test-suites no matter what project is associated with them.

* WAIT Implement symbol->string
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2009-12-16 Wed 19:49] \\
    Passing on this for the time being, I really would like to avoid having
    to do more string manipulation then strictly needed with respect to
    packages and symbols.
  :END:
Basic idea is taking any symbol and returning a string with a specified
package (defaulting to current one), and the name of the symbol.

* Safety
Section for general issues and notes with respect to keeping the system
safe for arbitrary code execution.

*** *readtable* in package
    It is probably not a very good idea to put this in the package
    itself and instead associate the readtable with the wrapper object
    safe-package. If the readtable is not stored in the package itself
    or the readtable is somehow made into a constant that cannot be
    changed ever inside the package... we should be safe.


* TODO Remove metatilities as a build dep [2/3]
  DEADLINE: <2009-12-27 Sun>
  Its huge, the dependencies conflict when we do asdf-install:install
  ... and was generally a bad day overall. I don't use that much out of
  that utility set, so its not worth requiring the whole thing.

  - [X] functional-tests
  - [X] nisp-safe
  - [ ] nisp

* BUG Changing symbol names too much
To the bot this should work:
: ? (documentation 'list 'function)

We get 
: ? (DOCUMENTATION 'LIST '|SAFE-nixeagle::EighthBit::staff|::FUNCTION)
instead

* DONE Make CL-WALKER ASDF installable
  CLOSED: [2009-12-24 Thu 20:36]
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-12-24 Thu 20:36]
  :END:
  At least give it a system definition.
  - Never had to be done

* BUG TRIVIAL-TIMEOUT style-warning
-+  style-warning (1)
 `-- The variable COM.METABANG.TRIVIAL-TIMEOUT::C is defined but never used.
-+  warning (1)
 `-- COMPILE-FILE warned while performing #<COMPILE-OP NIL {100617AD41}> on
     #<CL-SOURCE-FILE "nispbot" {1004A69201}>.

* BUG Clozure drops to debugger on nispbot input
  Not totally sure why atm, needs fixed at some point. The problem is
  the timeout seems to also abort the debugger which is different
  behavior then with sbcl.

* TODO Define property-list type
  Verify input is a property list etc.
* TODO move NEXT-PRIME out of :i
  Best place for this one is in nistilities as its own subsystem.

* TODO Split functional-tests from nisp
  DEADLINE: <2009-12-29 Tue>
  This is starting to become independent of :nisp itself. I don't want
  to force others to pull in all of nisp for just that framework.

  Update: Now has its own asd definition, needs to be split into its own
  repository at some point in the future.
