    Each contains a sequence of bytes in [[wp:little-endian][little-endian order]]. [fn:1] There
    are 2, 4, and 8 unsigned integers following this format. Anything of
    variable width starts with a two byte field that indicates how long it
    is.

    Text strings are not null terminated. The NUL character is illegal in
    all text strings in 9P.


***** Message Format
      Starts with a 4 byte field that says the length in bytes of the
      whole message including the 4 bytes of the size field.

      Next byte is the message type which is enumerated in =fcall.h=

      Next 2 bytes are an identifying tag.

      Whats left are parameters of different sizes.
