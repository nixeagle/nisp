macro but is used only for simple templating. A fixture created
with DEF-FIXTURE is a macro which can use the special macrolet
&BODY to specify where the body should go.

*note* that this overrides the default 5am DEF-FIXTURE. 5am's
DEF-FIXTURE evals itself too much causing a SBCL compiler warning
about redefining a symbol."
