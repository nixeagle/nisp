      Major changes include:

     - splitting nisp-safe from nisp
     - removing metatilities as a dependency from nisp-safe
     - add dependency on cl-walker to nisp-safe. This is not used yet but is
       very likely to be used in the near future.
     - nisp-introspect has been moved into the nisp-safe system for now. The
       future of this one generic method system is uncertain. It is very
       likely not required and was written before I knew some things.
     - nispbot is now an object that superclasses connection
     - nisp-safe now works with objects
     - stub of new test framework focused on functional programming started.
     - many other changes, see changelog for reference [2009-12-22 Tue]

      Tests sort of run, no way to automatically verify the results yet,
      but its possible to add tests to a fbound symbol, remove them, map
      over them/run them returning the results and get a list of all
      fbound symbols with a test on them.

      - functional-tests
        - Added deftype fbound
        - Added is-set-equalp
        - Added fbound-plist-test-p
        - Added remove-fbound-plist-test
        - Added add-fbound-plist-test
        - Added clear-fbound-plist-test
        - Modified set-fbound-plist-tests
          - Removed (declare ...) and (the ...) and placed them in an
            ftype instead of inside the function proper.
        - Mdified make-io-set
          - Type checks were added to the io-set class, and they failed
            when the io-set was created with :output output where output
            was nil.
        - Added find-tested-symbols
          - Pass a keyword, symbol, or package and get a list of symbols
            that have tests on them. This works for the plist tests only
            right now.

******* functional-tests
        - Remove add-test-to-plist
          - Replaced by add-fbound-plist-test.
        - Remove _function-test_ class
          - Has no use as we use symbol plists instead of a seperate
            class now. Makes the chore of tracking tests easier to just
            associate with the function being tested directly
        - Remove make-function-test
        - Remove some specializers of run-test-set
        - Remove _define-function-test_
          - Macro for function-test creation, not used anymore since
            function-test is gone.
        - Remove add-test-set
        - Remove add-test-to-plist
          - This was largely useless as it could only add one test.
        - Add class [[io-log]].
