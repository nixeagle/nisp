      Major changes include:

     - splitting nisp-safe from nisp
     - removing metatilities as a dependency from nisp-safe
     - add dependency on cl-walker to nisp-safe. This is not used yet but is
       very likely to be used in the near future.
     - nisp-introspect has been moved into the nisp-safe system for now. The
       future of this one generic method system is uncertain. It is very
       likely not required and was written before I knew some things.
     - nispbot is now an object that superclasses connection
     - nisp-safe now works with objects
     - stub of new test framework focused on functional programming started.
     - many other changes, see changelog for reference [2009-12-22 Tue]

          - Type checks were added to the io-set class, and they failed
