Notes on the nisp.irc framework

* Characters
  - The protocol is based on 8bit octects.
    - delimiters and keywords are usable from a US-ASCII terminal
    - extra case'd characters 
      - Lowercase: ={= =}= =|= =^=
      - Uppercase: =[= =]= =\= =~=
      - NOTE: unreal does not do this casemapping.
        - CASEMAPPING=ascii means ={= and =[=
* Messages
*** Ending chars
    Always end with \r\n, in lisp: =(#\Return #\Newline)=
