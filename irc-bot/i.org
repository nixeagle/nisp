#+TITLE: 'i' experiments


* Definitions :definition:
*** TODO connection
    Might not make any sense once we get into data-sources and
    data-sinks. A connection might be an active instance of a sink or a
    source (or possibly both?). This will not have the same meaning as I
    originally conceived.

*** TODO protocol
    Data encoding

*** DONE provider
    CLOSED: [2010-03-02 Tue 01:23]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-03-02 Tue 01:23]
    :END:
    What organization, company, website, domain are we dealing with. There
    is only one json [[protocol]], but multiple people/services/websites use
    it.

*** DONE medium
    CLOSED: [2010-03-02 Tue 01:24]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-03-02 Tue 01:24]
    :END:
    Combination of both protocol and service. Order here matters! The
    protocol in use always takes priority over the service in use!

***** DONE data-source
      CLOSED: [2010-03-02 Tue 01:23]
      :LOGBOOK:
      - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-03-02 Tue 01:23]
      :END:
      Superclasses medium and indicates what [[protocol]]/[[provider]] is the data
      coming from.

***** DONE data-sink
      CLOSED: [2010-03-02 Tue 01:24]
      :LOGBOOK:
      - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-03-02 Tue 01:24]
      :END:
      Superclasses medium and indicates what [[protocol]]/[[provider]] is the data
      going to go to.

*** TODO to
*** TODO from

*** TODO identity
*** TODO message-content
    A message itself and what operations are sane to do message contents.

    1) text
    2) binary
    3) other?
*** DONE action
    CLOSED: [2010-03-02 Tue 01:38]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-03-02 Tue 01:38]
    :END:
    Actions are things people do within a protocol. We do not usually
    think of doing an action to a service[fn:1]. This is right now easier
    to define by example:

    1) We can PRIVMSG people from irc -> irc
    2) We can MSG people from jabber -> irc with the translation being
       that of the jabber message command being translated to PRIVMSG.
    3) You can MSG from irc -> twitter's protocol where the translation is
       from IRC's PRIVMSG -> a "tweet".


* Tasks
*** TODO Rewrite command routing system to new MOP hackery
    Move [[file:bot.lisp]] command routing system to new MOP hackery to
    emulate a network using generic functions.


* Footnotes

[fn:1] Not that actions based on services cannot be defined, its possible
for action types to combine with same [[protocol]] in both the source/sink
ends but differentiate based on which services are in the
combination. There really is nothing you cannot do with this type, but
this type generally has the most meaning within the context of a protocol.
