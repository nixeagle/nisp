This message means that a function outside of a socalled 'safe' package

1) create an empty package, eg one with no internal symbols
2) runs read-from-string using the package as the *PACKAGE* variable.
3) reads the following string \"cl::+\".
4) If cl::+ is an fbound symbol a critical assumption failed
   or a regression has occured.
