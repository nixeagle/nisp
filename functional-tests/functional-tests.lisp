;;;test framework idea: embed the test and expected results in the
;;;docstring itself in addition to more specialized tests by
;;;function. Even better is defining the tests seperately and modifying
;;;the function docstring to append examples and such. Thus the test
;;;becomes part of the function's own documentation. See
;;;(metatilities:depreciated) and (metatilities:make-obsolete) for how
;;;to do this. That way the tests become the documentation.

;;;It is very important that we do not get outside of testing *one*
;;;function at a time and gearing the tests to that. Doing them any
;;;other way just adds extra overhead that really does not need to
;;;exist. I don't want to type the function's name repeatedly, and I
;;;want the testcases to show up with (describe) for online
;;;help. Examples work very well with instructing others how a system is
;;;intended to be used.

;;; I am not 100% positive how functions with side effects will be
;;; tested other then attempting to isolate the sideeffects, maybe by
;;; using some of the work being done in :nisp-safe to allow a function
;;; to modify its own package without touching stuff otuside of it.

;;; Right from the start I want to indicate that heirarchical tests are
;;; not an intended feature outside of not running tests that use a
;;; function with a failed test. But that is not doing explicent nested
;;; test suites as done by those that follow the *Unit philosopy. Please
;;; understand I've tried 3 different frameworks extensively and none of
;;; them really fit the way lisp is designed. We don't have objects that
;;; *contain* methods. We have functions that act on objects. Test the
;;; *functions* and the object is tested as well.
;;;
;;; Tests will be placed into the same package as it is defined by
;;; default as the function it is testing. Alternatively an option will
;;; be given to put the tests in a seperate package defined by the
;;; application programmer. Running the tests is as easy as picking one
;;; test and running it, or running all tests in a single
;;; package. Grouping beyond that is to be left to the application
;;; programmer. Tools like mapc and others exist for this reason. I
;;; don't want to take too much control over the tests away from the
;;; programmer.

;;Require at minimum an object to hold the function being tested, This
;;can contain function wide profiling information (profile no profile),
;;test/pass results for the group of IOsets on the function as well as
;;what functions should be traced if tracing is turned on during the
;;test execution. We can determine dependency information somewhat from
;;the trace list, but be sure to include a way to mention a function
;;dependency without tracing.

;;an object that contains an IO set, which is one input matched to
;;expected error, output or value. Something like: (or output (xor error
;;value)) are valid combinations. The IO set could also log the results
;;for each call with that input as well as store if that set should be
;;traced or not on the input/output level. Of course use a few macros to
;;abstract msot of those ugly details away. A test should look something
;;like this:

;;(define-test function-name :profile t :trace nil
;; "some documentation if wanted, else default to function docs"
