#+TITLE: Github api oddities

This is just a list of strangeness that the github api has. These may or
may not be actual bugs.

* Unfollow does not actually unfollow
  You can follow a user with the api, but you can't unfollow them.

* Disabling bug tracker does not disable issues api.
  If you untick the bug tracker checkbox, the issues api still works and
  allows you to add issues as if the tracker was still visible on the
  github site.


* Cannot view labels on a project I am a collaborator on
  You can view them on your project, you can see labels on their project
  you are a collaborator on in the web interface, but you can't view
  those same labels in the api interface.
