#+TITLE: github api

Important! This library is not API stable! In general functions and
objects exported from [[file:package.lisp]] will not have their interfaces
changed without a major version increment. Anything else is subject to
my whim and fancy. Of course the idea is all functions end up exported
;).

With that aside, the major principle we follow is functions either
return a *single* object or they return a list of objects. In some
extremely simple cases, we return lists of strings or lists of other non
CLOS objects.

As of this writing [2010-01-30 Sat], all current v2 github APIs are
implemented if not release ready or vetted for an interface I'm
comfortable with maintaining.
