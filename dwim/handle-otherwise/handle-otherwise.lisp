;;; Snagged from hu.dwim.util. Its in its own package so cl-walker can
;;; depend on that rather then on all of hu.dwim.util which is huge! Of
;;; course there is the small problem of "no documentation" but at least
;;; I don't need to pull in 100 dependencies.
;;;
;;; The only meaningful change I did was to prefix def with hu.dwim.def
;;; instead of using that package.
