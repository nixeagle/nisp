#+TITLE: loki notes

Name is an accident arising from typoing ioke when searching wikipedia for
loke (lisp ioke). I typed loki which turns up a rather interesting article
on a norse god named [[en:Loki][Loki]]. She is a shapeshifter much as io and ioke are
both shape shifting languages.

    instance basis.

*** imitator
    These are equivalent to common lisp subclasses but work on a per
    instance bases. Strictly speaking objects don't need to maintain a
    list of subclasses in ioke, but we do here for implementation
    effeciantcy
