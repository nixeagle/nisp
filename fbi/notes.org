Every packet is JSON, ending in \n so ...
 : (read-sequence-until (make-string-stream PACKET) #\Newline)


: (let ((sock (socket-connect "server" port)))
:   (write-sequence (concatenate 'string "{\"action\":\"auth\",\"user\":\"nixeagle's component\",\"secret\":\"hil0l\"}" (string #\Newline)) 
:                   (socket-stream sock))
:   (socket-close sock))

fbi routing is named components and named channels

components subscribe to channels

when component pushes all subscribers get the packet and a sender

* Subscription
  subscribing to a channel is sent as an array and the array is sent back.
  : {"action":"subscribe","channels":["commits"]}

packets with "url" entry will get sent to is.gd and stuck in "shorturl"



* IRC danopia
<danopia> no PM back means it doesn't handle it
<danopia> but it's also rather faily in taht instead of being stateful
<danopia> the IRC bot's first publish just says the network and channel  [04:09]
<danopia> and the component tells it where to send hte message
<danopia> instead of jsut saying "ok reply with this" to the irc component
