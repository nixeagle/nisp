  "Compare FBOUND-CALL using PREDICATE using series of ARGS.

This macro has some funny destructuring.
  - If the first of ARGS is a string, its taken as the reason/docstring. 
    This defaults to \"No reason given.\". However when a docstring is given
    this docstring will apply for all argument/return value pairs until another
    docstring is given.
  - The next of ARGS _must_ be a list. These are supplied to FBOUND as arguments.
  - Finally the next member of ARGS is used as the expected return result.
    The correct predicate to use is looked up from `with-fbound-samep' unless
    the keyword PREDICATE is non-nil.
    _however_ if the last member is one of the following, magic happens:
    - :signals or :should-signal followed by condition-spec:
      Expand into (signals (condition-spec <generated formatstring> docstring))
    - :finishes or :should-finish
      Expand into (finishes ...)
    - :expects or :should-be followed by type-spec
      Expand into (is (typep <function/arguments> type-spec) docstring)
    - :satisfies or :should-satisfy followed by predicate
      Expand into (is (predicate <function/arguments>) docstring)"
